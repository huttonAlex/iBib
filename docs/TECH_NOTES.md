# Technical Notes

This document captures technical findings, experiment results, and lessons learned during development.

## Purpose

- Document experimental results
- Track library/technology evaluations
- Record performance measurements
- Capture field test observations
- Note gotchas and lessons learned

## Format

Entries are organized by phase and date. Each entry should include:
- **Date**: When the finding was made
- **Phase/Milestone**: Context within project
- **Topic**: What was investigated
- **Findings**: What was learned
- **Implications**: How this affects the project
- **References**: Links, papers, code samples
